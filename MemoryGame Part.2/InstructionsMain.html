        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Memory Game is a simple game of matching pairs. There are a number of tiles on the board with different images on them, and your goal is to match each tile with its identical pair by flipping over two tiles at a time.</p>
        <p>When you click on a tile, it will flip over and reveal the image on its other side. If you flip over two tiles that match, they will stay face up. If you flip over two tiles that don't match, they will flip back over and you will need to try again.</p>
        <p>The game is won when all tiles have been matched and are face up.</p>
        <p>For starting the game click on the "Start Game" button and the game will start automatically</p>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>The game is timed, so try to match all the tiles as quickly as possible to get a high score.</p>
